        "In machine learning, our goal is to create a program that is able to perform tasks it has never been explicitly taught to perform. The way we do is to use data we have collected to train or fit a mathematical or statistical model. The data used to fit the model is called training data.\n",

        "To solve this proplem, machine learning engieers set aside a portion of the data, called test data and use it to assess the performance of the trained model, as opposed to including it as part of the training dataset.\n",
